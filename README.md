===========

This repo is a place for me to implement of some simple algorithms, as a way of learning about those algorithms.  Part of the goal is to code the algorithms "from scratch", so avoiding standard libraries and Collections.  So, for example, in order to code Dijkstra's, I created my own priority queue, backed by a binary heap.  In order to represent graphs, I created my own linked list class.
